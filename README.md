# To-Do List Application

This is a **To-Do List Application** built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. It helps users manage tasks by adding, editing, marking as completed, and removing items from their task list. The app provides a simple and user-friendly interface to keep track of daily activities.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to demonstrate my ability to build a fully functional **JavaScript** application with dynamic UI updates. The To-Do List app allows users to add tasks, mark tasks as completed, delete tasks, and also edit existing tasks. 

### Features

- **Add New Tasks:** Users can add new tasks by typing into the input field and hitting the "Enter".
- **Edit Tasks:** Users can edit existing tasks by clicking an edit button/icon beside the task.
- **Mark Tasks as Completed:** Users can mark tasks as completed by clicking the checkbox beside the task.
- **Remove Tasks:** Users can delete tasks from the list by clicking the delete icon/button.

## Tech Stack
